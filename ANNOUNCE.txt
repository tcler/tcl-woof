Changes since V0.3
------------------

There are many changes and enhancements to API's and
functionality. Only the major ones are listed
here.

- Woof! application code is now run in a safe Tcl
  interpreter for security reasons. 
  *INCOMPATIBILITY* If you are loading your
  own libraries, you may need to make some changes.
  See http://woof.magicsplat.com/woof-ug/_woof/docs/ug/interpreter
  and http://woof.magicsplat.com/woof-ug/_woof/docs/ug/loading_packages

- More flexible control of mapping URL's to controllers
  (similar to routes in Rails or Pylons)
  See http://woof.magicsplat.com/woof-ug/_woof/docs/ug/url_dispatcher

- Enhancements and changes to Woof! Template File
  format. In particular, controller variables now
  have to be explicitly brought into scope ( *INCOMPATIBILITY* )
  Also, support for new %( %) code blocks.

- Improved support for language-specific pages.
