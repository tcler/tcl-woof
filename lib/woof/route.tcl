    # The string is evaluated as a Tcl script in a safe interpreter.
    # It may include any Tcl code and in addition the following
    # commands that set up the dispatch routes.
    #
    #   curl CURL ACTIONS PURL
    # The command curl defines a controller route.
    # CURL - controller URL path (relative URL)
    # ACTIONS - list of actions included in this definition
    # PURL - URL for parameter definitions
    # The command creates a definition mapping a (relative) URL to
    # a controller.
    #
    # CURL specifies the URL for the controller and may include a module path.
    # The last component of CURL is the controller name and any prior
    # components specify the module
    #
    # ACTIONS specifies the action methods for which the definition is
    # applicable. This may be a list of action names,
    # an empty list which
    # indicates the definition applies to all actions, or a string beginning
    # with 'implicit:'. In this last case, the URL is treated as not having
    # an action component and any remaining components after the controller
    # are matched against parameter definitions. The string after the
    # 'implicit:' prefix is treated as the action method to invoke.
    # 
    # PURL is a URL path that defines additional parameters that are
    # supplied in the rest of the URL. Note these are not the explicit
    # parameters sent as part of a query or form post but rather additional
    # parameters that may be merged with them. Each component in this
    # PURL should have the format
    #    PARAMNAME:REGEXP:DEFAULT
    # where PARAMNAME specifies the name of the parameter, REGEXP, if not
    # empty, specifies a regular expression that the URL component should
    # match, and DEFAULT is the default value to be used if the URL 
    # component is missing. DEFAULT is actually passed through the
    # Tcl subst command with -nocommands options hence variable
    # definitions and backslash sequences can be used.
    #
    # In addition, PARAMNAME field of the last path component in PURL
    # may be of the form
    #     *NAME
    # in which case the corresponding parameter is a list of all remaining URL
    # component values.
    #
    # Note that the ':' character in the default value should be
    # encoded using \u Tcl escape sequences else it will be treated
    # as the start of the default value as opposed to be embedded in
    # it.
    #
    # The returned route structures can be passed to select and construct
    # to map URL's to controller actions and vice-versa.

    # Create a safe interpreter to protect against arbitrary (malicious)
    # input in config files (although here we do not care since we
    # trust whoever wrote the routes!)
    # Creating/destroying safe interpreters is
    # cheap enough so we recreate on every call. Keeping it around would
    # require state from previous invocation to be cleaned up which is
