#### Ruff! - Runtime Function Formatter

Ruff! is a documentation generation system for Tcl that uses source
code introspection in conjunction with comment analysis to generate
programming reference manuals. 
Although part of Woof!, it can be used independently.

In comparison with source code based
documentation generators, Ruff! produces documentation that not only
requires less effort from the programmer, but is also more complete,
more accurate and more maintainable.
