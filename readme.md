Version 0.5 beta of Woof! has been released.

## What is Woof!

Woof! - Web Oriented Object Framework - is an
open-source, platform and server-independent, web
application framework written in the Tcl
programming language. It is intended to be easy to
install and deploy, simple to understand and
customize, and embeddable into other applications.

* Platform independent (requires Tcl 8.6)
* Web server agnostic with CGI, SCGI support and API's for writing 
  adapters for other interfaces
* Configurable page layouts
* Templates with inheritance
* Pluggable template engines
* Support for responsive web design
* Pure CSS controls
* Built-in query, session and cookie handling
* Flexible routing with matching URL generation
* Localization support
* Development aids - built-in web server, scaffolding tool,
  documentation generator, interactive debugging console
* Comprehensive documentation (well, getting there)


## Files

The download area is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/woof/files/

bowwow-VERSION.exe is a single file Windows executable
with Woof, Tcl and a web server built in and no
external dependencies. Just download and run.

woof-VERSION.zip and woof-VERSION.tar.gz are source
distributions for use with other web servers.

woof-VERSION-prerequisites.zip contains some Tcl packages that
are needed by Woof! and bundled together for convenience. Many
Tcl installations will already have these in place.


## Requirements

See http://woof.sourceforge.net/woof-ug/_woof/docs/ug/system_requirements.
Woof! has been tested with IIS on Windows,
Apache on Debian Wheezy and Lighttpd on Ubuntu.


## Release Notes

This is the fourth public release of Woof! and is
intended to allow people to try out Woof! and
provide early feedback. The API is stabilizing but
still subject to change.

Unfortunately, Woof 0.5 has some incompatibilities with previous versions.
The page layout system in particular has been changed due to the underlying
YUI CSS libraries no longer being developed by Yahoo.
