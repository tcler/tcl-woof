<p>Our simple web site will have only two pages - one to generate the
Fibonacci number sequence and a help page.</p>

<p>Although we could create all the required files manually, we'll
save a bit of work by using the Woof! application generator
[my _chapter_link wag wag]. If you are
  using <code>bowwow.exe</code>, this is built into the program:</p>

[my _code_sample {
C:\fibo> bowwow url fibonacci/generate fibonacci/help
Controller FibonacciController:
         File app/controllers/fibonacci_controller.tcl will be created.
         Class FibonacciController will be created.
         Methods to be added: generate, help.
         View stubs to be added:
                app/controllers/views/fibonacci-generate-main.wtf
                app/controllers/views/fibonacci-help-main.wtf
Do you want to continue? [YN] y
}]

<p>If you are not using <code>bowwow.exe</code>, <code>wag</code> has
to be invoked as a script:</p>

[my _code_sample {
~/fibo> tclsh scripts/wag.tcl url fibonacci/generate fibonacci/help
}]

<p>
The <span class="wf_filename">url</span> command generates stubs for
the specified relative URL(s).
So the above commands will generate stubs for Web pages
that can be accessed through the
URL's <span class="wf_filename">http://localhost:8015/fibonacci/generate</span>
and <span class="wf_filename">http://localhost:8015/fibonacci/help</span>
respectively.</p>

<p>The command will first display the actions it will take in creating
the stubs, and then prompt for the go-ahead to actually do so. In this
Quick Start chapter, we will ignore the MVC-based naming conventions
being used when generating the stubs. It suffices to know that the
stub generator will create a class <span class='wf_code'>FibonacciController</span>
whose methods will be called to handle URL's that are prefixed
with <span class="wf_filename">/fibonacci</span>. The stub generator
also creates two methods
- <span class='wf_code'>generate</span> and <span class='wf_code'>help</span> - corresponding to the
two URL's we specified on the command line.</p>

<p>If you edit the file
<span class="wf_filename">app/controllers/fibonacci_controller.tcl</span>
under your BowWow directory, you will see the following contents:</p>

[my _code_sample {
    oo::class create FibonacciController {
        superclass ApplicationController
        constructor args {
            # Very important to pass arguments to parent
            next {*}$args
        }
    }
    oo::define FibonacciController {
        method generate {} {
            # Raise an exception that allows woofer to detect unimplemented actions
            ::woof::errors::exception WOOF NotImplemented "Action generate has no supporting implementation."
        }
        method help {} {
            # Raise an exception that allows woofer to detect unimplemented actions
            ::woof::errors::exception WOOF NotImplemented "Action help has no supporting implementation."
        }
    }
}]

<p>As you can see, the stubs will generate exceptions if invoked. For
example, navigating
to <span class="wf_filename">http://localhost:8015/fibonacci/help</span>
will result in an error page being displayed in the browser.</p>
