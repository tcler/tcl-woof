<p>To follow along, you need to first do one of the following</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are on Windows, you can simply download and run the
    self-contained [my _chapter_link bowwow_exe "BowWow executable"].
    No other software (web server,
    a Tcl installation etc.) is needed.
    <strong>This is the quickest way to try
      out Woof! and the application can be easily moved later to a
      different web server with no changes.</strong></li>
  <li>On all platforms, you can 
    [my _chapter_link installation "download and extract"] a Woof!
    distribution and run the
    [my _chapter_link bowwow_script "<code>bowwow</code> script"]. A Tcl 8.6 shell
    must have been previously installed on your system. This script
    runs a simple web server, [my _chapter_link bowwow_script "BowWow"],
    that can be used for trying out Woof!.
    Note that there
    is no need to run the [my _chapter_link installation installer] script
    to use the <code>bowwow.tcl</code> script.
  </li>
  <li>A third alternative is to install a suitable web server, Tcl 8.6
    and Woof! as described in 
    the [my _chapter_link "installation"] chapter. This provides a production
    environment but entails a few more steps for installation including
    running the [my _chapter_link installation installer] script.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, remember to follow
the [my _chapter_link installation_final_steps "installation verification"]
steps to ensure Woof! and the web server are installed and configured
correctly.</p>

<p>Although the application code runs unchanged between various web
servers, the commands for invoking various Woof! utilities, such as
stub generation, differs between the single-executable BowWow 
and the other configurations. 
In the former case, because the BowWow executable is
entirely self-contained, it is used to invoke various commands. For
example,</p>

[my _code_sample {
c:\fibo> bowwow url fibonacci/generate fibonacci/help
}]

<p>On the other hand, for the other configurations,
  <strong>including use of the</strong>
  <code>bowwow</code> <strong>script</strong>, the Tcl shell program
  has to be run for the same purpose, with an appropriate script.
  For example,</p>

[my _code_sample {
~/fibo> tclsh scripts/wag.tcl url fibonacci/generate fibonacci/help
}]

<p>Here it is assumed the command is run from the Woof! root
  directory <span class='wf_filename'>~/fibo</span>.
  Both forms of the commands are shown in this guide.</p>

<p>The URL's used in the examples assume you are running the web server on
port 8015 (which is the default BowWow port) and the Woof! application
URL root is /. If not, you will need to modify the example URL's
appropriately.</p>
