  The default layout template retrieves the page title from the
  [my _code title] key in the [my _chapter_link pagevar pagevar] object.
  This is generally be set by the application controller as </p>
[my _code_sample {
   pagevar set title "My Application"
}]
<p>
If unset, it defaults to the [my _code "name"] setting in the 
[my _code "app"] section of the
[my _chapter_link configuration "configuration file"].
