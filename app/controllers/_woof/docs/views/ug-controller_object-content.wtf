<p>In a [my _chapter_link mvc MVC] architecture, the controller is
responsible for handling user generated events and requests. Each type
of request is mapped to a specific method - an <em>action</em> - of a
controller. The action method contains the application logic to
appropriately handle the request. It is the responsibility of the
application writer to implement the specific action methods for a
controller.</p>

<h3>The <span class='wf_code'>Controller</span> class tree</h3>

<p>When an incoming request is [my _chapter_link url_dispatcher "mapped"]
to a controller class and action method, Woof! instantiates a controller
object of that class. All controller classes should be derived from
the [my _manpage_link ::woof::ApplicationController]
class. This is in turn derived from
[my _manpage_link ::woof::ApplicationController]
which encapsulates all the common functionality required of a
controller. Application writers should never directly
modify <span class='wf_code'>Controller</span> since that will cause conflicts with
Woof! updates. Instead, if common enhanced functions are to be added
to all controllers in the application, the changes should be made to
class <span class='wf_code'>ApplicationController</span>.</p>

<h3>The controller object execution context</h3>

<p>When a controller object is instantiated for a request, the
base <span class='wf_code'>Controller</span> class constructor sets up an execution
context for the methods implementing the actions. It provides simple
means for extracting parameters from the request, managing session
context, cookie handling and generating HTTP headers. It also provides
several procedures for common tasks such as URL generation and
redirection. </p>

<p>The objects and commands that are made available in the execution
context are summarized below and detailed in later sections.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>request</span></h4>

<p>The [my _chapter_link request_object "<span class='wf_code'>request</span>"]
 object encapsulates the attributes of the received request and provides
  methods to retrieve them.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>response</span></h4>

<p>Conversely,  the
[my _chapter_link response_object "<span class='wf_code'>response</span>"]
object is used to build the response to be sent back to the
client. The application should generally not directly manipulate this
object.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>page</span></h4>

<p>The [my _chapter_link page_sections "<span class='wf_code'>page</span>"] 
object holds the content of the web page and may be built either directly 
or through Woof! templates.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>session</span></h4>

<p>Session data, which supplies context that distinguishes between
interactions with different clients, is maintained in
[my _chapter_link session_object "<span class='wf_code'>session</span>"]
object.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>params</span></h4>

<p>Parameters passed in the client request are accessible through the 
[my _chapter_link params_object "<span class='wf_code'>params</span>"]
object.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>icookies</span></h4>

<p>Any HTTP cookies sent in the client request can be retrieved through the 
[my _chapter_link icookies_object "<span class='wf_code'>icookies</span>"]
object.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>ocookies</span></h4>

<p>The 
[my _chapter_link ocookies_object "<span class='wf_code'>ocookies</span>"]
object contains the output cookies that are to be returned in the response to
the client.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>flash</span></h4>

<p>The 
[my _chapter_link flash_object "<span class='wf_code'>flash</span>"] object
is used as transient storage to hold data that needs to persist only between
consecutive client requests.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>env</span></h4>

<p>The [my _chapter_link env_object "<span class='wf_code'>env</span>"]
object stores the environment passed in by the Web server. Generally,
applications should use the methods of the
[my _chapter_link request_object "<span class='wf_code'>request</span>"]
object as it hides differences between web servers.</p>

<h4><span class='wf_code'>headers</span></h4>

<p>The [my _chapter_link headers_object "<span class='wf_code'>headers</span>"]
object contains the HTTP headers that will sent in the response to the
client.</p>

<p>The above objects are available within the action methods as well
as in the [my _chapter_link wtf "templates"] since the latter also execute in
the context of the controller object. In addition,
the <span class='wf_code'>Controller</span> class provides several other utility
methods. Refer to its
[my _manpage_link ::woof::Controller "reference pages"] for more details.</p>

<h3>The <span class='wf_code'>ApplicationController</span> class</h3>

<p>The <span class='wf_code'>ApplicationController</span> class is defined to allow
the application programmer to add controller behaviours that are
common to all application controllers without having the modify
the <span class='wf_code'>Controller</span> class. Woof! itself does not add any new
variables or methods in this class and promises not to modify it in
future releases. Application writers should define all their
controllers to inherit from this
class. The [my _chapter_link woofus "woofus"] stubs generator
also generates stubs that follows this rule.</p>
