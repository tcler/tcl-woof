<p>
  <strong>Note: IIS support requires at least V0.3 of
Woof!</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://python.ca/scgi/protocol.txt">Simple Common
Gateway Interface</a> (SCGI) is a standard for communication between
web servers and application servers on the back end. It has several
performance advantages over CGI. This chapter describes configuring
IIS to use SCGI to communicate with a Woof!  application server on the
back end. The process of running Woof! as a SCGI application server is
described in the chapter [my _chapter_link start_scgi].
<p>SCGI support is not a standard part of IIS and you need to install
the isapi_scgi IIS extension to support it. You will also optionally
need to install a URL rewriting filter. Both procedures are described
below.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>This scenario makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have full control over IIS configuration.</li>
    <li>The server hosts the Woof! application alongside other applications.</li>
    <li>The application is rooted at /myapp, i.e. <span class="wf_filename">http://www.mysite.com/myapp</span> is the entry point into the application.</li>
    <li>You have the means to modify the system configuration so that the Woof! SCGI server is started automatically either at boot time or when IIS is started.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 1 - install Woof!</h3>

<p>Install Woof! for IIS and SCGI using 
using the [my _chapter_link installer "installer script"].</p>
[my _code_sample {
~/woof-dist> tclsh scripts/installer.tcl install iis scgi -installdir /myappdir
}]

<p>
  This will create the Woof!  
  [my _chapter_link directory_structure "directory structure"]
  under <span class="wf_filename">/myappdir</span>. In particular,
  the <span class="wf_filename">/myappdir/public</span> will contain the
  publically accessible directory tree that will be the document root
  for the Woof! application.</p>
<p>Since the Woof! application is not rooted
  at <span class="wf_filename">/</span> we also need to tell Woof! the
  application root URI, <span class="wf_filename">/myapp</span> in our
  case. For this purpose, we add the line below to the Woof!
  application [my _chapter_link configuration "configuration file"],
  which in our example will reside
  at <span class="wf_filename">/myappdir/config/application.cfg</span>.</p>

[my _code_sample {
set url_root /myapp
}]

<p>This will allow Woof! to correctly decode and generate URL's for
the Woof! application.</p>

<h3>Step 2 - install <code>isapi_scgi</code></h3>
<p>The <code>isapi_scgi</code> IIS extension for SCGI is open source
software that can be freely downloaded and used. A sample installation
is shown below. The <code>isapi_scgi</code> 
<a href="http://www.magicsplat.com">web
site</a> contains detailed download, installation and usage
instructions.</p>

<p>Download the extension from the <code>isapi_scgi</code> 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/twapi/files/">download
area</a>. Extract the <span class="wf_filename">isapi_scgi.dll</span>
file from the downloaded archive and place it in
the <span class="wf_filename">public</span> folder of your Woof!
installation (<span class="wf_filename">/myapp/public</span> in our
example).</p>

<h3>Step 3 - configure the application in IIS</h3>

<p>The sample session below illustrates installation under IIS 5.1 on
Windows XP. Installation under later versions of IIS will be
similar. The session shown configures IIS such that the extension will
be accessed under the
URL <span class="wf_filename">/myapp/isapi_scgi.dll/</span>. All
requests to URLs below this will be passed by the extension to the
SCGI server. In a later step, we will configure a IIS URL rewriter to
hide the use of the DLL so requests
under <span class="wf_filename">/myapp</span> will be passed to the
SCGI server.</p>

<p>Start up the MMC IIS manager and create a new virtual
directory, <span class="wf_filename">myapp</span>, under the default
Web site as shown in the screen shot below.</p>

<p class='wf_center'>
[my include_image iis_scgi_new_directory.png alt "Initial MMC screen"]
</p>

<p>This will bring up the MMC wizard. Click on
the <strong>Next</strong> button after filling the fields in each
wizard screen as shown in the sequence below.</p>

<p class='wf_center'>
[my include_image iis_scgi_wizard.png alt "Initial MMC wizard screen"]
</p>

<p>When prompted for the alias,
type <span class="wf_filename">myapp</span>. This is the URL root
under which we want the Woof! application to be accessed and must be
the same as the value of the <code>url_root</code> Woof! configuration
variable we used in Step 1 except for leaving out the leading
slash.</p>

<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_wizard_alias.png alt "MMC wizard alias screen"]
</p>

<p>The next screen prompts for the location of the physical directory
for the application. Here we enter the path to the public subdirectory
under our Woof! installation.</p>

<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_wizard_dir.png alt "MMC wizard directory screen"]
</p>
<p>When configuring directory permissions, we must select
the <strong>Execute</strong> check box as shown below
as <span class="wf_filename">isapi_scgi.dll</span> is a ISAPI
extension and requires this permission to run.</p>
<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_wizard_permissions.png alt "MMC wizard permissions screen"]
</p>
<p>Finally, click <strong>Finish</strong> to complete the wizard.</p>
<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_wizard_finish.png alt "MMC wizard finish screen"]
</p>
<p>After finishing the wizard, right click on the newly
created <span class="wf_filename">myapp</span> virtual directory and
configure its properties as shown below.</p>
<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_myapp_directory.png alt "myapp directory screen"]
</p>
<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image iis_scgi_myapp_properties.png alt "myapp properties screen"]
</p>
<p>As shown in the <strong>Properties</strong> page, as entered in the
wizard, the <span class="wf_filename">myapp</span> virtual directory
is mapped to our physical publically accessible
directory, <span class="wf_filename">/myappdir/public</span> and
the <strong>Execute Permissions</strong> setting allows executables to
run. The only change we make is setting the <strong>Application
Protection</strong> value to <code>Low</code> instead
of <code>Medium</code> for higher performance.</p>
<h3>Step 4 - configure SCGI</h3>
<p>If you are not running the default SCGI server address and port,
follow the steps described in
the <code>isapi_scgi</code> [my _chapter_link configuration "configuration manual"]
to set up <code>isapi_scgi</code> options. This step is not
required if you are running the default SCGI configuration.</p>
<h3>Step 5 - configure URL rewriting</h3>
<p>This step is optional but is usually desirable for various
reasons. The configuration steps described so far will result in the
Woof! SCGI server being invoked for URL's starting
with <span class="wf_filename">http://www.mysite.com/myapp/isapi_scgi.dll</span>. A
URL rewrite filter will allow this root URL to be changed
to <span class="wf_filename">http://www.mysite.com/myapp</span>
instead. This step is optional but is recommended for all the reasons
listed
in <a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/apache/url-rewriting-for-beginners/">Added
Bytes</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine">Wikipedia</a>. <em>If
you choose to skip this step, you must also change value of url_root
in Step 1 to /myapp/isapi_scgi.dll as that will be root URL for Woof!
without URL rewriting.</em></p>

<p>There are several URL rewriting solutions, both free and
commercial, available for IIS. This manual describes the use of the
free <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IIRF">Ionics Isapi Rewrite
Filter</a> (IIRF) V1.2.16. Procedures for other versions may
differ.</p>

<p>Follow Ionics' excellent 
<a href="http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IirfHelp/frames.htm">installation
instructions</a> to install IIRF. Then add the following lines to the
IIRF configuration file <span class="wf_filename">IsapiRewrite4.ini</span>
in the IIRF directory.</p>
[my _code_sample {
RewriteRule ^/myapp/images/(.*)$     /myapp/images/$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^/myapp/stylesheets/(.*)$     /myapp/stylesheets/$1 [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}     !-f
RewriteRule ^/myapp(.*)$            /myapp/isapi_scgi.dll$1 [U,L]
}]
<p>The first two lines ensure no rewriting is done for images and
stylesheets in the public directory that we want directly served by
IIS. The remaining lines rewrite URL's for which there is actual
existing file to <span class="wf_filename">isapi_scgi.dll</span> which
will then pass the request on to the Woof! SCGI server.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, once you have verified correct IIRF
operation, you may also want to add the following line
to <span class="wf_filename">IsapiRewrite4.ini</span> to reduce
overhead by turning off logging in IIRF.</p>
[my _code_sample {
RewriteLogLevel 0
}]
<h3>Step 6 - starting the SCGI server</h3>
<p>The Woof! SCGI server script that handles connections passed by
Apache needs to be started whenever Apache runs. This step is actually
independent of the web server and is described
in [my _chapter_link start_scgi].</p>

<h3>Completing the installation</h3>
<p>Once the steps described there are done, configuration is
complete. You can now move on to
[my _chapter_link installation_final_steps "completing the installation"].</p>
