<p>For navigation, we will put links in a column on the left of the
main area. Both pages will contain the same navigation links. For this
purpose, create the file
<span class="wf_filename">app/controllers/views/fibonacci-sidebar.wtf</span>
with the following contents:</p>
[my _code_sample {
<a href='[my url_for -action generate]'>Generate</a>
<br/>
<a href='[my url_for -action help]'>Help</a>
}]

<p>This is not the best HTML for navigation menus but it will do for
our purposes. Note the use of the <code>url_for</code> method to
generate the links instead of hardcoding to something
like <span class="wf_filename">/fibonacci/help</span>. Unlike
hard-coded links, links generated in this manner will not need to be
changed if somewhere down the road we change the URL to
be <span class="wf_filename">/mathsequences/fibonacci/help</span>.</p>

<p>In addition to the navigation menu, let us add a header as well to
brand our fibonacci generator. Create the file
<span class="wf_filename">app/controllers/views/fibonacci-header.wtf</span>
with the following contents:</p>
[my _code_sample {
<div style='padding: 10px;'>
 [my include_image /images/_woof/logo.png' style "float: left;"]
 <h2 style='line-height: 3em; margin-left: 160px;'>Fibonacci Generator</h2>
</div>
[my include_image /images/_woof/banner_separator.png']
}]

<p>Again, the HTML leaves something to be desired, and we are being
lazy in reusing some Woof images for illustrative purposes. The result
is shown in the browser below:</p>

<p class="wf_center">
[my include_image qs_nav.png alt "Quick Start Example Navigation page"]
</p>

<p>Let us now take a step back and look at how Woof! picked up the
contents of the files we created. The gory details are available in
the [my _chapter_link page_generation] chapter
but here is a short summary.</p>

<p>Woof! divides the displayed Web page into
several areas or <em>page sections</em>. Each page section is
generated from a template file (actually, this is only one of the ways
to generate a page section) and the various generated sections are
merged based on a <em>layout file</em>. All sections are of course
optional and the layout adjusts automatically for missing
sections. The logical page sections, placement in layout etc. are all
of course customizable and you can even create your own sections
but we will not go into that here. It is
expected however, that the default layout will suffice for most
purposes.</p>
