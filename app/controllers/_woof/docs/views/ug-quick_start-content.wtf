<p>This chapter provides an introduction to the development of Woof!
applications by going through the steps to create a simple but
functional web site. The site will allow users to generate Fibonacci
sequences since the world can never have enough of those. It is
assumed you have some familiarity with Web application concepts and
the Tcl language, preferably version 8.6 or later since Woof! makes
use of the core object capabilities in that version.</p>
