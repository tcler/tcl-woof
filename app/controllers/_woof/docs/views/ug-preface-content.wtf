<p><strong>Woof! - Web Oriented Object Framework - </strong>is an
  open-source, platform and server-independent web application framework
  written in the <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl</a> programming
  language. It is intended to be easy to install and deploy, simple to
  understand and customize, and embeddable into other applications.</p>
<p>Woof! provides programming facilities that simplify web development
  by taking care of those tasks that are commonly required in writing
  server-side Web applications. Woof! applications are portable and
  can be easily moved between platforms or web servers with minimal
  changes.</p>
<p>Woof! accelerates the development process through
  tools that enable incremental development, interactive server-side
  debugging and automatic documentation generation.</p>
<p>This guide assumes the reader is familiar with
  the <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl</a> programming language and
  development of Web server-side applications. If not, refer to the
  [my _chapter_link recommended_reading] chapter for a reading list.</p>
