<h3>The <span class='ug-code'>ApplicationController</span> class</h3>

<p>The <span class='ug-code'>ApplicationController</span> class is
  defined to allow 
  the application programmer to add controller behaviours that are
  common to all application controllers without having the modify
  the <span class='ug-code'>Controller</span> class.</p> 


<p>To ensure future compatibility, application writers should not
  directly modify the <span class='ug-code'>Controller</span> class
  and should not directly inherit from it. Instead, all controllers
  should be defined to inherit from
  <span class="ug-code">ApplicationController</span>.
  Woof! itself does not add any new
  variables or methods in this class and promises not to modify it in
  future releases.
  The [my _chapter_link wag "wag"] stubs generator
  also generates stubs that follows this rule.</p>

<h3>Defining a controller class</h3>

<p>A minimal controller class definitions takes the following form:</p>

[my _code_sample {
oo::class create SampleController {
    superclass ApplicationController
    constructor args {
        # Very important to pass arguments to parent
        next {*}$args

        ...other initialization code...

    }

    method index {} {
        # The default method for the controller
        ...some code here...
    }
}

}]

<p>As discussed above, the class derives from
<span class="ug-code">ApplicationController</span>. The constructor
passes any specified arguments to its base class and then completes
initialization. It is important to call the base class constructor
before using any of the standard objects such as 
<span class="ug-code">request</span>,
<span class="ug-code">session</span> etc.
created by the base
<span class="ug-code">Controller</span> class.</p>

<p>The initialization steps may include
  application-specific code as well as some standard Woof!
  code such as setting up
  [my _chapter_link default_page_layout "default layout"] parameters,
  [my _chapter_link using_stylesheets "stylesheets"] and so on.</p>

<h3>Controller class names and namespaces</h3>
<p>Controller classes are read into the
<span class="ug-code">::woof::app</span> namespace.
One important point to note is that the class name does not have
any namespace qualifiers in its definition. 
Even if the controller is defined to be in a
module, the class definition itself should generally not include the
namespace. Woof! will automatically instantiate the class into the
appropriate namespace based on the module name.</p>

<p>For example, assuming
the application URL root is <span class="ug-filename">/</span>, the
URL <span class="ug-filename">/mod1/mod2/my_sample/index</span>
corresponds to the <span class="ug-code">index</span> action in
controller <span class="ug-code">my_sample</span> in the module
<span class="ug-code">mod1::mod2</span>. The corresponding controller
implementation will be located under the Woof! directory in the file
<span class="ug-filename">app/controllers/mod1/mod2/sample_controller.tcl</span>.
The controller class as defined in the sample above (without any
namespace qualifiers), will be created as
<span class="ug-code">::woof::app::mod1::mod2::MySample</span>.</p>

<p>If at all namespace qualifiers are used, the
class name must be fully qualified and begin with 
<span class="ug-code">::woof::app</span> and include the module
namespaces if any. So the class definition above could have been
defined with the fully qualified name
<span class="ug-code">::woof::app::mod1::mod2::MySample</span>
but this is not recommended.</p>



<h3>The uses command</h3>
 
<p>Controllers may share behaviours through a common base
  class. To implement this, the common base class must be made available
  in the source file implementing the controller. To facilitate this,
  Woof! provides the [my _manpage_link ::woof::uses] command that can be
  used to import the base class definition. For example, the file
  <span class="ug-filename">sample_controller.tcl</span> shown above
  could be modified as shown below:</p>

[my _code_sample {
 uses BaseController
 oo::class create SampleController {
     superclass BaseController
     constructor args {
          Very important to pass arguments to parent
         next {*}$args
 
         ...other initialization code...
 
     }
 
     method index {} {
          The default method for the controller
         ...some code here...
     }
 }
 
}]
 
<p>Woof! will then look for, and automatically load the file
  <span class="ug-filename">base_controller.tcl</span>.</p>

<p>The argument provided to the <span class="ug-code">uses</span>
  command must be either an unqualified class name, in which case the
  corresponding file is expected to be in the same directory as the
  controller file calling <span class="ug-code">uses</span>, or it
  must be qualified with a relative namespace, in which case the
  corresponding file is located relative to the
  <span class="ug-filename">app/controllers</span> directory under the
  Woof! root.</p>
