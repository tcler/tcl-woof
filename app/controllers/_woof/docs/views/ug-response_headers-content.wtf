<p>Generally, Woof! automatically adds the required HTTP headers
to the response sent to the client and the application does not need
to explicitly set header values. Under special circumstances,
applications may set header values through the 
<span class='ug-code'>response</span> object methods. See the
[my _manpage_link ::woof::Response "API reference"]
for more details.</p>
