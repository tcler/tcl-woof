<p>
Responsive web pages often show menus in a vertical navigation pane if the
window is wide enough or as a horizontal bar on narrow windows. This
type of design is directly supported in Woof! through the
[my _manpage_link "::woof::pure::menu" ::woof::pure::menu] command.
See [my _chapter_link purecss_menu] for details.
