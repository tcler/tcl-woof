<p>The steps required to install Woof! depend on multiple factors such
as the specific web server, its configuration and the hosting
environment. The common steps required to install Woof! are described
below. Subsequent sections describe installing and configuring Woof!
in several different server-specific scenarios.</p>

[my _note {
As Woof! is still under development with a changing API,
it does not support installation on top of existing existing Woof! versions.
Please remove older versions first.
}]

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Woof! depends on Tcl 8.6.3 and the packages listed below. Note
this does not apply to the [my _chapter_link bowwow "<code>bowwow</code>"] 
executable which is self-contained.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>[my _code uri]</li>
  <li>[my _code fileutil]</li>
  <li>[my _code md5]</li>
  <li>[my _code uuid]</li>
  <li>[my _code html]</li>
  <li>[my _code ncgi]</li>
  <li>[my _code cmdline]</li>
</ul>
The above packages are all part of the
<a href='http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/home'>[my _code tcllib]</a> distribution.

<h3>Downloading Woof!</h3>
<p>Woof! can be downloaded from
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=250256'>SourceForge</a>.
It is is distributed in tar/gzip
(<span class="woof_filename">.tar.gz</span>) format for Unix/Linux,
and in zipped (<span class="woof_filename">.zip</span>) format for
Windows. The content of both archives are identical except for end of line
conventions. After
downloading, unpack the archive in a suitable directory. This
directory may be the same as the final location you want the Woof!
code to reside, or a temporary location. The installation step will
take care of both cases. Woof! itself only uses relative paths so it
can always be moved later. However, you will need to change the web
server configuration files accordingly.</p>
<p>There is one very important aspect to keep in mind - <em>the
final location for Woof! should lie outside the web server's document
tree</em>. Not following this recommendation requires careful
configuration of the web server to not expose your application source
code over the web.</p>
<h3>Installing the distribution</h3>
<p>After unpacking the distribution, running the 
<span class='ug-code'>installer</span>
script installs the
Woof! components for the specified web server and interface. For
example, the following command, executed from the woof distribution
directory, will install and configure Woof! components for Apache
using the SCGI interface.</p>
[my _code_sample {
woof-dist> tclsh scripts/installer.tcl install apache scgi
}]
<p>In the above example, the script assumes that Woof! is to be
installed in-place - i.e. woof-dist is the final location for Woof!
components. The following command, on the other hand, will install
Woof! in a different location.</p>
[my _code_sample {
woof-dist> tclsh scripts/installer.tcl install apache scgi -installdir ~/web-dev/woof
}]
<p>Note that the <code>installer.tcl</code> script only configures Woof! itself. The web
server configuration has to be modified separately. Examples are given
in the server specific configuration sections that
follow. The [my _chapter_link installer] chapter details specifics of
the install command.</p>
