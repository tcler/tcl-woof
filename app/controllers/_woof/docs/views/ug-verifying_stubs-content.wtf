<p>When generating stubs using <span class='ug-code'>wag</span>, it
is sometimes easy to lose track of which stubs have actually been
implemented and which are still to be
written. The <span class='ug-code'>verify</span> command
provides a way of checking which stubs remain to be written.</p>

<p>The example below is a continuation of the one in the previous section.</p>
[my _code_sample {
> tclsh scripts/wag.tcl verify
ApplicationController: no stubs found.
MathController:
        Action method stubs:
                multiply

        View stubs:
                app/controllers/views/math-multiply-main.wtf
}]

<p>The output shows that we have not actually implemented the stubs
for the <span class='ug-code'>multiply</span> action method and
corresponding view.</p>
