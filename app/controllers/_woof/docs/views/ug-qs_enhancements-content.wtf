<p> So we now have a somewhat functional Web site that can generate
Fibonacci numbers. However, we are not done as competition in the
Fibonacci generator space is fierce and we want to draw eyeballs from
our competitors' sites. We need to enhance the usability and
attractiveness of our site and make it more usable on small mobile
devices. Besides, we need to illustrate a few more
Woof! features. We will enhance the site in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will add navigation links so people can easily access the
  help and generator.</li>
  <li>We will make it easier to generate multiple numbers by
    allowing the user to specify how many elements of the sequence are
    to be generated.</li>
  <li>We will attempt to make the site more attractive through the use
    Pure CSS stylesheets and controls.</li>
  <li>We will make the site [my _chapter_link responsive_web_design responsive]
    to make is more usable on smartphones and other small-screen devices.
  <li>Finally, we will change the default page of the site to point to
    our Fibonacci site instead of the BowWow welcome page.</li>
</ul>
